Proper invocation of PlayGame.py: py .\PlayGame.py [WIDTH] [HEIGHT] [OPTIONAL: BROWNIAN]

We have found that a size of 125 x 60 fits most monitors and is a good balance of fun and performance. Feel free to mess around with it.

To play: simply run PlayGame.py with 2 arguments: the game width and game height. If you want to change the default brownian you can pass that as an optional 4th arguement.

To test: run EngineTest.py and check terimanl for output.
